# Recapping IPFS in Q4 2019 üéâ

From milestones like releases, projects like ProtoSchool, to the many new (and awesome) contributors who have joined us, and what‚Äôs to come for the rest of this year, we hope you enjoy this quarterly recap.

Thanks for being part of our community, we truly couldn‚Äôt make IPFS what is without you. ‚ù§Ô∏è
