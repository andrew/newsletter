# Recapping IPFS in Q4 2019 üéâ
We‚Äôve put together a very special issue looking back on all that you, the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) community, accomplished so far, in 2019. From milestones like releases, projects like ProtoSchool, to the many new (and awesome) contributors who have joined us, and what‚Äôs to come for the rest of this year, we hope you enjoy this quarterly recap.
