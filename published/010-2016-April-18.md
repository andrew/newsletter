# IPFS Weekly #10

[IPFS](//ipfs.io/) is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identities, aiming to make the web faster, safer, and more open. In these posts, we highlight some of the development that has happened in the past week. For anyone looking to get involved, follow the embedded hyperlinks, search the wealth of information on [GitHub](//github.com/ipfs) or join us on [IRC](//webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ipfs) (#ipfs on the Freenode network).

Here are some of the highlights for the [April 6th through April 18th](//github.com/ipfs/pm/issues/101) sprint:

## Updates

### 0.4.0

[go-ipfs 0.4.0](http://dist.ipfs.io/#go-ipfs) has been released! Among the many changes are a revamped implementation of the IPFS communication protocols, increased performance, improvements to IPNS (the Interplanetary Naming System), many bugfixes, and lots of new features to make IPFS even more powerful.

See the [blog](http://blog.ipfs.io/14-ipfs-0-4-0-released/) for more.

### [aegir](//github.com/dignifiedquire/aegir)

aegir release. npmjs.org/aegir, github.com/dignifiedquire/aegir

### go-libp2p

we're modularizing go-libp2p, aiming at module parity with js-ipfs. makes the codebase less daunting to newcomers, and making maintenance and testing of everything much easier.

### go-ipfs deps

@whyrusleeping removed over 9000 (yes, over 9000) lines of unused godeps dependencies from the go-ipfs repo. Its a good deal more manageable now, and we are getting ever closer to having a purely gx managed package.

### js-ipld

This week @dignifiedquire shipped an updated version of [js-ipld](https://npmjs.org/ipld) which now conforms to the [latest spec of IPLD](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/tree/master/ipld). In addition [js-ipfs-ipld](https://npmjs.org/ipfs-ipld) was created, which implements the building blocks to use IPLD in js-ipfs. The third package that was published is [js-ipfs-cli](https://npmjs.org/ipld-cli) which gives you a cli tool to interact and experiment with IPLD. 

#### `ipfs-blob-store` v1.0.0 released

One of the benefits that comes from the new [Files API](link to best description we have) in 0.4.0, is that we can emulate any kind of file system expectations on top of IPFS, and by doing so, enable applications that use a file system, to use IPFS without any modification. One perfect example of that are all the applications that use a module that implements the [abstract-blob-store](https://github.com/maxogden/abstract-blob-store) interface, now with [ipfs-blob-store](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-blob-store), with a simple `npm install`, you can swap out your current blob-store implementation by the IPFS one.

#### `js-ipfs-api` now supports the Files API

On the same lines, `js-ipfs-api` now offers all the Files API calls through a convenient and easy to use library. You can find all of the function declarations on the [`js-ipfs-api` docs](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-api/blob/master/API.md#files)

#### Making js-ipfs and js-libp2p modules awesome

@JGAntunes, @dignifiedquire, @nginnever, @diasdavid, and @noffle have been working hard to bring [the pantheon of js-ipfs modules](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+coverage+dignified) up to snuff: detailed READMEs with examples and full API docs, as well as 100% test coverage. We made significant inroads last sprint on [js-peer-id](https://github.com/diasdavid/js-peer-id), [js-multiaddr](https://github.com/jbenet/js-multiaddr), [js-peer-info](https://github.com/diasdavid/js-peer-info), [js-ipfs-blocks](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-blocks/) and more! There are a lot more modules that still need good READMEs and docs, so [dive in](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+coverage+dignified+is%3Aopen) and give us a hand!

## Community

### Peergos

Work on [Peergos](https://github.com/ianopolous/Peergos) is progressing well. We're close to getting a FUSE binding working. Throughput hasn't been as bad as we were expecting with all the encryption and erasure coding, and it's looking likely that it will end up being network IO bound, instead of CPU bound for non trivial writes. 

### SpaceX Landing

Things are awesome and getting awesomer.
