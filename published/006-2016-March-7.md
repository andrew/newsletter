# IPFS Weekly #6

[IPFS](//ipfs.io/) is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identities, aiming to make the web faster, safer, and more open. In these posts, we highlight some of the development that has happened in the past week. For anyone looking to get involved, follow the embedded hyperlinks, search the wealth of information on [GitHub](//github.com/ipfs) or join us on [IRC](//webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ipfs) (#ipfs on the Freenode network).

If you would like to get this update as an email, sign up for our [weekly newsletter](//tinyletter.com/ipfsweekly)!

## Updates

* [**__Repo__**](//github.com/)



## Community

#### [**name-your-contributors**](//github.com/RichardLitt/name-your-contributors)

@RichardLitt gave a talk at [BostonJS](TODO) on Thursday to around fifty people, about how the `name-your-contributors` module is used in this newsletter. The theme of the meetup was community building; if you have any ideas for improving either the Contributor list below, check out [this repository](github.com/RichardLitt/name-your-contributors) and let us know. Since the talk, @RichardLitt also added [get-pr-creators](https://github.com/RichardLitt/get-pr-creators) to the module, so that everyone who opens a PR (even if it isn't merged) get's added to the contributors list. Has your name been included?


## Contributors

Across the entire IPFS GitHub organization, the following people have committed code, created issues, or made a comment on GitHub between February 29th (noon, GMT) and March 7th. We're autogenerating this list using [this tool](//github.com/ipfs/weekly/blob/master/tools/get_commits.py) and [this other tool](//github.com/richardlitt/name-your-contributors), so please let us know if your name isn't here.

- __Contributors__

This newsletter is also a community effort. If you have cool things to share for the next weekly, drop a comment about it in [the weekly repo](//github.com/ipfs/weekly! The more people mention items they want to see in the weekly there, the easier it is to make this and send it out.

Thanks, and see you next week!
