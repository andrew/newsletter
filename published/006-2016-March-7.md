# IPFS Weekly #6

[IPFS](//ipfs.io/) is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identities, aiming to make the web faster, safer, and more open. In these posts, we highlight some of the development that has happened in the past week. For anyone looking to get involved, follow the embedded hyperlinks, search the wealth of information on [GitHub](//github.com/ipfs) or join us on [IRC](//webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ipfs) (#ipfs on the Freenode network).

If you would like to get this update as an email, sign up for our [weekly newsletter](//tinyletter.com/ipfsweekly)!

Here are some of the highlights for the [first week of March](//github.com/ipfs/pm/issues/93):

## Updates

#### [**station**](//github.com/ipfs/station)

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1211152/13579734/e5dd5c96-e496-11e5-99cf-f3c09943f2f4.png)

The new version of `station` is ready for developer preview! `station` is one of the easiest ways to get an IPFS daemon running it your machine. It acts as a service and you get many convenient features, such as the ability to  turn a IPFS node on through a GUI and drag and drop to share through IPFS. To try it out, you need Node.js 4 and npm 3 installed, then do the following:

```
> git clone https://github.com/ipfs/station.git && cd station
> npm install
> npm start
```

#### [**website**](//github.com/ipfs/website)

The list of [API Commands](https://ipfs.io/docs/commands/) on the website has been updated. This provides a single place to look through all of the CLI commands for go-ipfs, at once; it is a good reference point if you're not sure exactly which command to use next, and `ipfs commands` seems sparse.

#### **AUR**

@Kubuxu has made sure that `gx`, `gx-go`, and `ipget` are available on [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org), the arch-linux user repository. This means that it will be easier to get and install these on linux platforms.

#### [**karma-peer**](https://github.com/dignifiedquire/karma-peer)

@dignifiedquire's work on [karma-peer](https://github.com/dignifiedquire/karma-peer) means that it now has the ability to dynamically launch browsers, which will help @diasdavid, and hopefully more people, to write better tests for js-libp2p in the browser. See an example of some tests, here: [Example Tests](https://github.com/dignifiedquire/karma-peer/blob/master/test/index.spec.js).

#### [**randor**](http://github.com/dignifiedquire/randor)

@dignifiedquire has been working on [randor](http://github.com/dignifiedquire/randor), a testing framework that will be able to send huge files and lots of requests into IPFS in order to test how it works for edge cases and how it scales. Randor is now able to rerun tests predictably based on stored data, so it's easy to find and fix bugs. @whyrusleeping is already working on the first bug that randor detected. To contribute, check out the repository.

#### [**webrtc**](https://github.com/diasdavid/webrtc-explorer)

WebRTC Explorer 2.0.0 has been alpha released! WebRTC Explorer is essentially a way to bring Packet Switching to the Application Level, using WebRTC Data Channels as the transportation layer between nodes. WebRTC enables communication between browsers without needing mediators (servers), enabling us, the users, to route packets between machines, using only Web technologies. WebRTC is inspired by the Chord routing scheme to create routing tables that are evenly balanced across nodes. @diasdavid wrote up a more extensive [blog post here](http://blog.daviddias.me/2016/02/28/webrtc-explorer-2-0-0-alpha-release), and has an introductory video [here](https://youtu.be/fNQGGGE__zI).

#### [**libp2p**](https://github.com/diasdavid/js-libp2p)

@diasdavid made two new modules for stream muxing: [libp2p-spdy](https://github.com/diasdavid/js-libp2p-spdy) and [libp2p-multiplex](https://github.com/diasdavid/js-libp2p-multiplex). As well, [libp2p-swarm](https://github.com/diasdavid/js-libp2p-swarm) has a new API, more tests, less magic, and more flexibility. There is an open PR to track these changes; if you'd like to get involved, [follow it](https://github.com/diasdavid/js-libp2p-swarm/pull/20). Or, join in by checking out the latest [captain.log](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/30#issuecomment-187950929).

#### **ipfs-pad**

We want to build an Etherpad-like product on top of IPFS. There's a lot of
technical ground to cover to do this: how do we know how to sort edits? How do
we deal with high latencies (days/weeks), or with simultaneous edits? How is the
data transported? @noffle has been spearheading the process behind building
this, and this week made a host of modules to resolve some of its dependencies:

- [bisecting-numbers](https://github.com/noffle/bisecting-numbers) -
  Integer-like number system where any number can be bisected to form infinite
  integer subsystems.
- [bisecting-between](https://github.com/noffle/bisecting-between) - Produces a
  unique value that sorts between two other given values.
- [hyperswarm](https://github.com/noffle/hyperswarm) - Create a p2p webrtc swarm
  around a [hyperlog](https://github.com/mafintosh/hyperlog).

(He also wrote a little [README
generator](https://github.com/noffle/generate-readme) to help him out with his
JS module READMEs.)

#### **pubsub**

@noffle also published a couple of early mad science modules that enable a
peer-to-peer overlay network for gossip-based message exchange. These aren't
strictly built for IPFS, but are an experimental shim to enable projects like
@haad's [orbit-db](https://github.com/haadcode/orbit-db) to operate without a
central server for message exchange between peers.

- [secure-gossip](https://github.com/noffle/secure-gossip) - Secure, transport
  agnostic, message gossip protocol. Any peer in the network can publish
  messages, which will eventually propagate to the entire network via rounds of
  gossip between each node's peers.
- [pubsub-swarm](https://github.com/noffle/pubsub-swarm) - Form a p2p swarm of
  nodes around a topic and exchange messages, with a traditional pubsub API.

#### [**go-ipfs**](//github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs)

@whyrusleeping set up [Teamcity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/). This cuts down on the long waits for Travis to run, and hopefully will mean faster CI tests. Teamcity also gives us awesome metrics on our tests and nice statistics on failures and failure rates. Teamcity also has nice integration with a large array of test runners, from go tests to karma and sharness. It will give us more detailed feedback about our test runs, even when successful.

#### [**fc00**](https://github.com/fc00/spec)

@lgierth spent a productive week in Paris, and chatted with @cjdelisle and @ansuz at @xwiki-labs about the state and future of cjdns/fc00, layed out ideas for routing improvements, and drafted spec documents for the switch and cryptoauth layers. You can find those specs [here](https://github.com/fc00/spec/pulls) (they'll be updated soon). Work will continue on these for the rest of March. The switch and routing layers of fc00 might be the foundation of a smarter swarm for IPFS/libp2p, so this is all very exciting.

## Community

#### [**name-your-contributors**](//github.com/RichardLitt/name-your-contributors)

@RichardLitt gave a talk at [BostonJS](http://bostonjs.com/) on Thursday to around fifty people, about how the `name-your-contributors` module is used in this newsletter. The theme of the meetup was community building; if you have any ideas for improving either the Contributor list below, check out [this repository](github.com/RichardLitt/name-your-contributors) and let us know. Since the talk, @RichardLitt also added [get-pr-creators](https://github.com/RichardLitt/get-pr-creators) to the module, so that everyone who opens a PR (even if it isn't merged) get's added to the contributors list. Has your name been included?

#### **dignifed hacks**

@dignifiedquire launched a live-stream of him coding, which he is calling "dignified hacks". The first was last Monday where he recorded himself doing a new feature for the [WebUI](https://github.com/ipfs/webui). There were some technical issues, but he'll do another one this week. One of the viewes, @nginnver, said it "was helpful for a quick view of our components and data flow in the webui." We will announce regular showtimes on [twitter](https://twitter.com/dignifiedquire) and you can subscribe to [IPFS on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdjsUXJ3QawK4O5L1kqqsew) where future episodes will be hosted.

This newsletter is also a community effort. If you have cool things to share for the next weekly, drop a comment about it in [the weekly repo](//github.com/ipfs/weekly! The more people mention items they want to see in the weekly there, the easier it is to make this and send it out.

Thanks, and see you next week!
