# Welcome to the IPFS Weekly

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening lately in the [InterPlanetary File System](https://ipfs.io/) galaxy and beyond! üöÄ


## ProtoSchool explores the Async Iterables returned by js-ipfs 0.41
The recent release of js-ipfs 0.41 introduced a huge async/await refactor, and the breaking changes were no joke! Jos√© has updated our affected ProtoSchool tutorials to reflect the recent changes, highlighting which js-ipfs methods now return Async Iterables and how you can use /for await‚Ä¶of/ loops or alternative helper modules to work with them.

*Check out the updated content in our*## Mutable File System (MFS)  and  Regular Files API  tutorials, then  help us spread the word  on Twitter.

## Using IPFS to fight COVID-19
Here are some ways people in the dweb space are responding to the COVID-19 pandemic with their skills. 

We have a Cord19 collaborative cluster dataset now but it is not too useful if the people that would use it don't know that they can access this content from the IPFS network.
