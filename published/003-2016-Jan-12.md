# IPFS Weekly #3

[IPFS](//ipfs.io/) is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identities, aiming to make the web faster, safer, and more open. In these posts, we highlight some of the development that has happened in the past week. For anyone looking to get involved, follow the embedded hyperlinks, search the wealth of information on [GitHub](//github.com/ipfs) or join us on [IRC](//webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ipfs) (#ipfs on the Freenode network).

Here are some of the highlights for the [January 12th](//github.com/ipfs/pm/issues/79) Sprint:

## Updates

* [**go-ipfs**](//github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs) 0.3.11 is shipped! Also, we merged 0.4.0 into master. [@jbenet](//github.com/jbenet), [@Dignifiedquire](//github.com/Dignifiedquire) and others [fixed appveyor](//github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/2137). And finally the latest webui by [@Dignifiedquire](//github.com/Dignifiedquire) was pushed in 0.3.11.
* [**ipfs-merkle-dag**](//github.com/vijayee/ipfs-merkle-dag) [@daviddias](//github.com/daviddias) worked on the js ipfs merkle-dag implementation, as well as putting in a lot of work in general on js-ipfs.

## Work in Progress
* [**weekly**](//github.com/ipfs/weekly) [@RichardLitt](//github.com/RichardLitt) put a lot of work in getting various sorts of attribution for contributors to IPFS, currently available as [name-your-contributors](//github.com/RichardLitt/name-your-contributors). This is almost done, but there are a few tweaks left to do.

## Contributors

Across the entire IPFS GitHub organization, the following people have committed code since January 4th. (We're autogenerating this list using [this tool](//github.com/ipfs/weekly/blob/master/tools/get_commits.py), so please let us know if your name isn't here.) In the future, we will also include people who comment, as they are also super important; bear with us while we develop that technology.

// TODO Add this
// I was hoping to have name-your-contributors done, but there's been a few bugs, particularly with get-code-reviewers. Now I need to go through and add a 'since' and 'until' option to all of the submodules to get the right time, as currently it'll grab from the past week, as well. Not ideal.
// [@achin](//github.com/achin), can you throw me the contribs, for now? Yours has a timespan argument, right?

Thanks, and see you next week!  If you have cool things to share for the next weekly, drop us a line in the [next weekly sprint issue](//github.com/ipfs/pm/issues/83)!
