## Welcome to the IPFS Weekly. üëã

The [InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)](https://ipfs.io/) is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identity. IPFS enables the creation of completely distributed applications. It aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open. Since that‚Äôs a pretty large scope, we track development across the ecosystem in this weekly dispatch.

Here are some of the highlights since the last IPFS Weekly.


## Meet the Community: Alan Shaw, IPFS Core

With the first-ever IPFS Camp right around the corner, we‚Äôre interviewing some of the community members who are making this highly anticipated event a reality.

### Tell us a bit about yourself and your background. How did you get involved with IPFS and end up joining the team at Protocol Labs?

Ok, quick recap of my whole life. Started building websites when I was 16 and basically continued that for nearly 20 years. It means I fondly remember things like tables, frames, IE6, Netscape Navigator, pixel perfect websites, a time before `border-radius` and `box-shadow`, Flash and ActionScript, CSS Zen Garden, Firebug, MooTools, jQuery and the like. Wow ok, I can‚Äôt finish that list there‚Äôs too much.

I‚Äôm basically a developer who started with frontend, moved to backend and now I just tickle whichever end needs to be tackled, including the IoT end. I have a LOT of experience with JavaScript. I‚Äôve worked with a lot of different programming languages in my career but you just always have to do some JavaScript. JavaScript is the one constant in my life and I love it, but that could be Stockholm syndrome talking.

I‚Äôve not had a real job for almost my whole life. I had a couple of years at a ‚Äúnew media agency‚Äù building expensive websites for businesses but I quickly became a freelancer (a.k.a. went and did a snowboard season in New Zealand) and after many freelance gigs spanning multiple years, I eventually founded a company with [Oli Evans](https://github.com/olizilla).

We focused on building really great MVPs for entrepreneurs in really short iterations. We basically took the developer practice of ‚Äúsprints‚Äù and applied it directly to working with our clients. Each week we wrote a work plan for 5 days of work. The idea was to have something useable at the end of the week, so it worked really well at focusing the client‚Äôs hopes and dreams into just the things we could achieve. We got the client to sign off on the work plan each week and then when the week was done they got something to play with.

From there, the client could either go away and never speak to us again, or book in another week, with new ideas for how we could improve the product or new features they wanted to add. Often as the weeks progressed the thing we built differed drastically from the client‚Äôs original plan and was probably all the better for it.

The company had a big focus on community, training and mentoring. We organised a number of tech meetups in the London area and got to know the community. Notably, we organised the London [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) and [Nodebots](https://nodebots.io/) meetups. The whole company also regularly attended tech conferences and Oli was invited to give a talk at [LXJS in Lisbon in 2013](http://2013.lxjs.org/). We met some super rad people there but the most ‚Äúrad-est‚Äù person was [David Dias](https://github.com/daviddias/) who went on to organise [LXJS 2014](http://2014.lxjs.org/) and he invited us back to run a [Nodebots workshop](https://youtu.be/L894YhZBz3k).

David Dias went on to work with [&yet](https://andyet.com/) but eventually got involved with IPFS (I believe through work on his university thesis). He started by building the JS implementation of IPFS and went on to become project lead. That‚Äôs a story for him to tell, but once he was in, David got us involved to work on a number of projects for IPFS. We started working on the peripheral but gradually ended up working on bigger, more core things. Personally, I love what [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai/) is doing and how ambitious it is‚Äîas an eternal optimist (often times to my detriment) this pleases me.

So we were more than happy to have Protocol as a client and eventually they ate us. I joke, there was a time where we had a lull in other client work and we were spending most of our time on Protocol work. David had (basically from day 1) been asking us to join up and on a chance visit to London he brought up the subject again and we reconsidered...

### Why should people be excited about IPFS?

IPFS is going to completely change the way people think about storage, addressing, networking and ownership of data. There are so many good ideas in IPFS it‚Äôs easy to deep dive into the technical details but, how about this:

Imagine a world where a copy of a file doesn‚Äôt actually consume any additional disk space. Maybe I should explain that a little‚Äîwhy would I have two of the same file? Well, it happens. Often I don‚Äôt have two of the _exact_ same file, but I have two files that have some bytes in common. When this happens, IPFS can share those bytes between those two files. Imagine how much disk space you‚Äôd save if this happened for _all_ of your files!

Imagine what BitTorrent or any one of the old p2p file sharing apps did for individual files but for all files on your computer or the internet.

Imagine two people in the same office downloading the same file and not having to move the same bytes across the Atlantic twice!

Imagine not having to worry so much about man-in-the-middle attacks because the content you received was _automatically verified_ to be the content you asked for.

Imagine a world where DoS attacks don‚Äôt really exist because there‚Äôs no central place to send the attack at.

Imagine a world where offline first _actually_ works by default.

Imagine building a website and not having to buy an SSL certificate just so your browser doesn‚Äôt flag it as ‚Äúinsecure‚Äù to your customers.

Imagine a world where CDNs don‚Äôt have to exist because the whole network is one giant CDN.

Imagine a world where you don‚Äôt have to share all your data with a big corporate entity where it would be mined and profiled and monetised. Imagine not being a product that companies sell to advertisers.

This is why people should be excited about IPFS...and I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôve missed a whole bunch of good reasons.

### What projects are really exciting you in the IPFS Ecosystem at the moment and why?

We‚Äôve been collaborating with the people behind [Brave](https://brave.com/) browser for a long time now and I believe we‚Äôre on the verge of shipping an IPFS integration, installed by default with the browser. It‚Äôs a small step towards a future where _all browsers_ are p2p by default. That is _very_ exciting.

### Open Source communities are full of unsung heroes. Is there someone in IPFS community who you admire for their work?

I really admire the work [Irakli](https://github.com/gozala/) has been doing to get p2p into Firefox with [libdweb](https://github.com/mozilla/libdweb) and his service worker explorations with [lunet](https://github.com/Gozala/lunet). He‚Äôs been really active in the IPFS community for a long time and truly understands the importance of p2p technology in the browser. He also has sound opinions about API design.

### What are you most looking forward to at IPFS Camp?

Science Fair. I absolutely _love_ mad science and experimenting.
