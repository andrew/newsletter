## Welcome back to the IPFS Weekly. ðŸ‘‹

The [InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)](https://ipfs.io/) is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identities. IPFS enables the creation of completely distributed applications. It aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open. Since thatâ€™s a pretty large scope, we track development across the ecosystem in this weekly dispatch.
