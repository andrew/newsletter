## Welcome to the IPFS Weekly. 👋

The [InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)](https://ipfs.io/) is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identity. IPFS enables the creation of completely distributed applications. It aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open. Since that’s a pretty large scope, we track development across the ecosystem in this weekly dispatch.

## Meet Yurko 👾

Last week, we mentioned [live-streaming over IPFS](https://github.com/tomeshnet/ipfs-live-streaming), and as it just so happens, at last week’s IPFS Weekly Call, Yurko was on hand to share it with us. Yurko is an IT native with two decades of experience and an active IPFS contributor. They are also a member of [Toronto Mesh](https://tomesh.net/), a group of folks building a mesh network for, you guessed it, Toronto! To learn more about live-streaming over IPFS, [check out the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFsKl6UMwqM&feature=youtu.be&t=435) from last week’s meeting to see Yurko explain it.
