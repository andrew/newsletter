# IPFS Newsletter #__Issue__

[IPFS](//ipfs.io/) is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identities, aiming to make the web faster, safer, and more open. In these posts, we highlight some of the development that has happened since the last newsletter. For anyone looking to get involved, follow the embedded hyperlinks, search the wealth of information on [GitHub](//github.com/ipfs) or join us on [IRC](//webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ipfs) (#ipfs on the Freenode network).

If you would like to get this update as an email, sign up for our [newsletter](//tinyletter.com/ipfsweekly)!

This newsletter is also a community effort. If you have cool things to share for the next newsletter, drop a comment about it in the [next sprint issue](__TODO__)! The more people mention items they want to see in the newsletter there, the easier it is to make this and send it out.

Thanks, and see you next time!
