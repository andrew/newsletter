# IPFS Weekly #__Issue__

[IPFS](//ipfs.io/) is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identities, aiming to make the web faster, safer, and more open. In these posts, we highlight some of the development that has happened in the past week. For anyone looking to get involved, follow the embedded hyperlinks, search the wealth of information on [GitHub](//github.com/ipfs) or join us on [IRC](//webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ipfs) (#ipfs on the Freenode network).

This newsletter is also a community effort. If you have cool things to share for the next weekly, drop a comment about it in the [next weekly sprint issue](__TODO__)! The more people mention items they want to see in the weekly there, the easier it is to make this and send it out.

Thanks, and see you next week!
