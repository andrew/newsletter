Prepare and store our weekly roundup emails.

## Idea

Similar to the [Rust community's](https://this-week-in-rust.org/), we want to have a weekly roundup that talks about what was done in the past week by varous contributors. This will help:

  - Keep people in the loop about what is going on at Protocol Labs and on IPFS.
  - Tell active contributors when new versions or tools are available.
  - Attribute developers who have contributed to open-source software related to IPFS.

## This repo

- Stores the drafts for past weekly roundups, posted elsewhere - the blog, email, and so on;
- Tracks issues related to the roundups in the [issues](https://github.com/ipfs/roundups/issues/);
- Stores tools used to make the roundups

## Contribute

Please help us out if you think the roundup could be better! [Open an issue!](https://github.com/ipfs/roundups/issues/new)
