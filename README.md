## Idea

Similar to the [Rust community's](https://this-week-in-rust.org/), we want to have a weekly roundup that talks about what was done in the past week by varous contributors. This will help:

  - Keep people in the loop about what is going on at Protocol Labs and on IPFS.
  - Tell active contributors when new versions or tools are available.
  - Attribute developers who have contributed to open-source software related to IPFS.

## This repo

- Stores the drafts for past weekly roundups, posted elsewhere - the blog, email, and so on;
- Tracks issues related to the roundups in the [issues](https://github.com/ipfs/roundups/issues/);
- Stores tools used to make the roundups

# Contribute

Please help us out if you think the roundup could be better! [Open an issue!](https://github.com/ipfs/roundups/issues/new)

## Process for writing 'IPFS Weekly' roundup

- Open a Pull Request to create a new Markdown formatted file in the `roundups` folder.
- Collect feedback/iterate on the draft, and merge it after 24 hours.
- Crosspost to ipfs/ipfs; if you need a core contributor to do this, get in touch with @jbenet
- Crosspost to the blog; if you need a core contributor to do this, get in touch with @jbenet

## Styleguide & Suggestions

  - Use people's GitHub handles and not their real names. Example: @RichardLitt, and not "Richard Littauer".
  - Try and include everyone who has made a PR or commented on an issue. Often, issue comments are _major, pivotal_ contributions, and those should be captured!
  - Highlight, don't just summarize; a lot of work may be trivial, and higher signal is better noise.
  - In general, err on the side of giving credit to everyone involved. When people do the lion's share, mention them first. (Or even something like "@whyrusleeping and several others ... " if relevant. In the case of a release, you can link to the changelog which credits individually... but don't sweat this.)
  - Add a line somewhere, either end of first paragraph or end of email, requesting feedback on the Weekly with a link to the GitHub issue in the Weekly repo to capture that feedback.
  - In general, try linking larger phrases instead of single words. easier to notice + click on links.
  - In general, try highlighting _why_ something is cool.
